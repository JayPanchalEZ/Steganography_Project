# Hiding a Text or Message inside an Image using Steganography

This is a simple command-line tool that hides encrypted messages inside images using **AES encryption** and **LSB steganography**. It can run on any platform, and allows users to securely embed or extract secret messages from `.png` images.

### üõ†Ô∏è About the Project

I built this tool as a final task during my internship, where I explored the concepts of:

- **Cryptography (AES-CBC encryption)**
- **Steganography (Least Significant Bit embedding)**
- **Basic image handling using OpenCV**
- **Cross-platform Python scripting**

This project helped me understand how encryption and data hiding techniques work together, and how to create a complete, usable tool from scratch.
